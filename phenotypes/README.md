# Phenotypes
* Where phenotypes use an existing clinical terminology (SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, OPCS-4) then the relevant codelists are supplied as `.csv` files.
* For phenotypes using proprietary dataset-specific fields then examples are provided using simplified SQL queries in `.sql` files as a form of pseudocode which may be easily ported to different research environments.
* Researchers working with the NHS Digital Trusted Research environment may find it easier to modify the analytical code from the Databricks notebooks [`CCU013_01_create_table_aliases.py`](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU013_01_ENG-COVID-19_event_phenotyping/blob/main/code/01_phenotype_engineering/CCU013_01_create_table_aliases.py) and [`CCU013_02_master_phenotypes.py`](https://github.com/BHFDSC/CCU013_01_ENG-COVID-19_event_phenotyping/blob/main/code/01_phenotype_engineering/CCU013_02_master_phenotypes.py). Note that if working outside the CVD-COVID-UK data access agreement (DARS-NIC-381078-Y9C5K) the database paths will need to be amended accordingly.

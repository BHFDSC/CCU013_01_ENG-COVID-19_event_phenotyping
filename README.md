## Project approval

Data access approval was granted to the CVD-COVID-UK consortium (under project proposal CCU013: High-throughput electronic health record phenotyping approaches) through the NHS Digital online [Data Access Request Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/data-access-request-service-dars) (ref. DARS-NIC-381078-Y9C5K). NHS Digital data have been made available for research under the [Control of Patient Information (COPI) notice](https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus/coronavirus-covid-19-response-information-governance-hub/control-of-patient-information-copi-notice) which mandated the sharing of national electronic health records for COVID-19 research.
